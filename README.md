# data_analysis

Project 'Female Statistics' represents data preprocessing, cleaning and analysis using linear fit and principal component analysis in R.
#1. In our analysis we have elaborated on the dependencies between income, labor involvement and education in women population, their 
#interrelations and association with maternal mortality and life expectancy. We saw that the countries can be subdivided into several groups
# according to their relations between those #variables. 
#2. We have a nonlinear relation between human development index (HDI) and income per capita in women After transforming the data we applied linear
# fit which gave us a statistically significant result. Here we can see that the income is a robust, reliable predictor of HDI.
#3. We tried to perform the Principal Component Analysis. What we got there are actually (and not surprisingly) main composites of HDI: we have several factors, representing #education, standard of living and "wellness" of society for women. This shows that the tools work ok.
